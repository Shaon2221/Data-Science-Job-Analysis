About the team:

The Study team strives to help learners meet their study goals across all of our supported platforms. This includes improving upon core product features, researching better ways to practice and master the content in Quizlet, and looking for ways to improve our study modes like the ML adaptive Learn mode. Our current projects include modernizing the Study modes with shared core logic using Kotlin Multiplatform, expanding the data model to support new user experiences, and rearchitecting the way we store our user-generated data to support massive scalability.

As a cross-functional team, we have engineers from Android, iOS, and Web working together with members from Product, Design, Data Science, Data Analytics, Product Support, and Marketing, to improve and develop new learning experiences. We also work closely with user research to understand how people use our product and what’s getting in their way to practice and master whatever they are learning.
One of our recent mobile projects has been improving our Flashcards study mode experience by updating the design of the feature to a more intuitive swiping flow that allows users to make piles for what they know and don’t know. We’re currently working on a big leap in grading user’s written answers to semantically interpret their input and give them feedback on how well they understand conceptually.
About the role:
Collaborate with Product, Design, Data Science, and other software engineers to define and develop new features like Smart Grading and Study Paths that help our users feel more comfortable learning new material

Code reviewing team PRs and sharing your own so that other team engineers have visibility into what we're building and how we've designed it.
Plenty of heads down time to execute on the team plan - whether that's improving our cross-platform ML-powered grading integration, building out a fully personalized learning experience in our study modes, or something else entirely!

About Us: At Emendata, we help bridge the gap between data and the real world. We partner with organizations that have a social mission and help them tackle their problems using analytics. Our role in these partnerships goes end to end—we handle everything from wrangling the data to analyzing the problem to turning the results into something actionable. Importantly, we understand that this analytics pipeline does not live in a vacuum. Getting to meaningful numbers requires more than just the right methods; it calls for understanding the people, policies, data, and systems involved. With this approach, our small but fast-growing team is having a big impact, taking on challenges like using analytics to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare.
About the Role: This role leads the way in producing analytics that reflect a deep level of understanding and a high degree of quality. We are looking for you to:
Take analyses from end to end: Understand the client’s problem, identify the right research question, plan the methodology, corral the data, code the analysis, interpret the results, craft the deliverable, and communicate the story
Apply a research mentality: Use all tools at our disposal (documentation, policy regulations, data investigations, etc.) to make sound analytic decisions
Help the team deliver its best work: Turn direction from clients/senior staff into tactical plans and work closely with data analysts to help them implement (conducting code reviews, teaching/reinforcing analytic strategies, etc.)
This role will be a good fit for people who naturally push towards progress and are undeterred when that requires a lot of effort or stepping into unfamiliar territory. Emendata is growing rapidly, and we are looking for people who are excited to march forward together.
Qualifications: If you do not meet all the criteria below but still think you would be a good fit for this role, please apply so we can see if we can find the right spot for you on the team. We value experience but also welcome aptitude and enthusiasm.
Education: Bachelor’s or master’s degree in a quantitative field or equivalent technical training
Programming: Experience with SAS is a must (comfortable with SAS macro language, advanced DATA step techniques such as hashes, and PROC SQL); experience with Python, Stata, R, or SQL is a plus
Technical Mentorship: Demonstrated experience with reviewing code and providing feedback
Data Management: Comfortable with the process of importing, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis in a reproducible way
Analysis: Exceptional problem-solving skills with a good understanding of statistical/social science research methods; 4+ years hands-on experience in an analytics role (e.g., economic consulting)
Working Style: Intellectually curious (keep pulling on threads until finding an answer), enterprising (eager to tackle the unknown and find a way to make things happen), and collaborative (work with others to explore, build, tear down, and build again)
To be considered for this position, applicants must have the ability to work in the U.S. without a need for current or future visa sponsorship.
About the Interview Process: We want both sides to learn what it would be like to work together. Part way through the interview process, we incorporate a lightweight at-home exercise that serves as the basis for a technical interview.

As a Senior Android Engineer, an average day likely starts by sharing your daily progress status with your team in Slack on what you accomplished yesterday, what you hope to accomplish today, and anything that is getting in your way or in the way of the team, then meet with team and huddle together to discuss progress towards our sprint goals around 10 AM PT.
At the beginning of the sprint, you’ll meet with the team to plan the sprint and discuss what goals the team can accomplish in the sprint and what will need to be done to accomplish them. Similarly, at the end of the sprint, you’ll meet for a team retrospective to discuss what has gone well and what could be improved in our sprint process.
Typically, the team aims to schedule meetings between 10 am and 2 pm, so that you have blocks of uninterrupted time in the morning and the afternoon to focus.
During the uninterrupted time, typically you get deep into coding and building the things you researched and estimated. You can also use that time to research a project and identify what will need to be groomed with the product manager, or what you questions you need to ask the designer, or how does the project need to be structured to work with our data along a data scientist, or what specific events will the data analyst need to answer our experiment hypothesis.
This research allows you to understand the product requirements and create Jira issues to later estimate with a larger group of Android engineers to ensure your approach is sound and others are familiar with your decisions, and ultimately to help you estimate the work so it can be later scheduled into a sprint. Once you code the feature and build the tests to ensure it works as designed, you create a pull request where you can help other engineers learn how you built the new feature or fixed a defect, and get feedback to grow as a developer.
Outside the team process and meetings, the Android team also meets biweekly and discusses upcoming projects and progress being made on the platform from the other teams with Android engineers.

Sandia will conduct a pre-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Furthermore, employees in New Mexico need to pass a U.S. Air Force background screen for access to Kirtland Air Force Base. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause access to be denied or terminated, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment.

If hired without a clearance and it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain and maintain one for the position, or you bid on positions that require a clearance, a pre-processing background review may be conducted prior to a required federal background investigation. Applicants for a DOE security clearance need to be U.S. citizens. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain a security clearance may be impacted.

Members of the workforce (MOWs) hired at Sandia who require uncleared access for greater than 179 days during their employment, are required to go through the Uncleared Personal Identity Verification (UPIV) process. Access includes physical and/or cyber (logical) access, as well as remote access to any NNSA information technology (IT) systems. UPIV requirements are not applicable to individuals who require a DOE personnel security clearance for the performance of their SNL employment or to foreign nationals. The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions) and OF-306 (Declaration of for Federal Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.

Steelcase was founded as an office furniture maker, and we've evolved into the global leader in workplace solutions. We apply our insights to the intersection of space, technology, and furniture, helping individuals and teams in leading companies around the world to have a better day at work.

We pursue innovation, strive for sustainability and develop insights in every part of our business.

Why people choose to work with us:

Let's start with the cool workspace—after all, that's our business. But that's just one of the ways we help people like you do their best work. We encourage curiosity and critical thinking, we embrace wellbeing in its broadest sense and we provide coaching and inspiration at every step of your career journey.

About the Operations Analytics team

Operations Analytics is a new team at Steelcase created to support the specific analytics needs of various Operations functions like Quality, Distribution, Engineering, Procurement, etc. It is a cross-functional team which combines analytical capabilities with dedicated subject matter expertise sourced from Operations functions and the data engineering capabilities of our IT function. We work on operations problems which require data processing and analysis to improve business outcomes such as predictive maintenance, yield optimization problems, analytics supported decision making, or operations related customer satisfaction projects.

What you will do

As an analyst in the Operations Analytics team you will play a fundamental role in the projects we undertake. For some projects you will be expected to guide a project from initial scoping all the way to the deployment into production of the solution created. For other projects you will serve as an internal analytics consultant and get involved at specific stages of the project when the work is sufficiently advanced. Throughout every project you will work closely with the subject matter experts embedded in the team, our data engineers, and related functions like the Advanced Analytics team to develop solutions that improve business outcomes in a dramatic way. As part of the role you will be expected to:
Work with subject matter experts to clearly scope projects and thoroughly understand the context and data available to address the problem at hand.
Support and when needed direct data wrangling efforts to ensure data is accurate and actionable.
Test and select the various analytical approaches appropriate to a given problem type.
Create and fine-tune the models we use to achieve the desired business outcomes (whether it’s a predictive or prescriptive model, or simply an explanation of the results of an analysis).
Pilot the deployment of analytics products into various operations functions and fine-tune models and approaches based on feedback and pilot data.
Help and guide the implementation of solutions into production environments. This includes deployment from a software point of view as well as practical deployment into our physical manufacturing plants and distribution centers (i.e. making sure the right information reaches the appropriate decision-makers at the right time).
Support ongoing efforts to fine tune analytics products even after deployment into production.
In this role you will have a chance to learn from and be mentored by experienced data scientists across the various analytics teams at Steelcase, and to gain first-hand experience solving real-world operations analytics problems from start to finish.
Occasional travel may be required but will likely be less than 10% of your time.


What you bring

The ideal candidate for this position is a quick-learner who is able to adapt to a variety of problems and approaches. You will undoubtedly encounter problems which you are not familiar with and which call for approaches or models you might have not used before. Although a base of technical proficiency is required, more important than any specific knowledge you may bring, is your ability to learn what you need to know quickly.

No operations experience is needed, but a curious mindset will be important to be successful. We are looking for an overall analytics athlete with the right attitude and a desire to work on real-world analytics projects with all the messiness they entail. For all candidates we are looking for the following attributes:
Technical proficiency – We generally work with common packages in Python or R. Some experience with these tools will be required. Familiarity with basic analytical techniques (e.g. regressions, decisions trees, Bayes classifiers, time series forecasting, clustering, etc.) will also be needed. You will need to help figure out what statistical approach yields the best results for a given problem, and fine-tune the parameters of the models we develop. Any applicable domain specific knowledge you might bring (e.g. machine learning) is a plus, but not required. You don’t need to be familiar with any specific data infrastructure tools we use at Steelcase, we expect you to pick-up those skills as needed.
Adaptable and ownership mindset – Real-world analytics is messy. Be prepared to try and discard multiple approaches to a problem in quick succession. The ability to adapt to the changing nature of the problems we tackle as our understanding of them evolves will be key to your success. A strong sense of ownership over the business outcomes we are trying to achieve will serve you well in this role and beyond.
Business Problem Solving – The data science is only half the battle. Successful analytics efforts start with robust business problem solving. Projects don’t start with a well-defined data set and target variable; they get there by applying good problem solving to abstract business problems that need to be defined, broken down into components, iterated upon, and eventually analyzed. Your ability to translate a business problem into a data science problem that directly impacts the desired outcomes will be a critical tool in your toolkit.
Communication – You will regularly communicate the progress and results of a project to a variety of stakeholders, including senior operations leaders. Your ability to create and deliver effective presentations and documents which clearly and succinctly summarize complex ideas and approaches in broadly accessible language will be key to ensure that a project progresses from a robust model to an implemented solution.
People development – At Steelcase finding and developing the best talent is a priority. You will participate in various professional development activities alongside our other analytics functions. In turn you will be expected to also invest in developing the capabilities of our organization and in particular the subject matter experts that are part of this team. If you enjoy learning and teaching analytics you will likely enjoy this role.


Preferred Experience

To be successful in this role you will likely have some academic and professional experience that develops this skillset. We will consider candidates with profiles that are suitable for either a Data Analyst role or Sr. Data Analyst roles depending on your level of experience. Regardless of which role best describes your experience we will look for the following:
Degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Data Science, Predictive Analytics, Economics, Operations Research or other related technical field is highly preferred; advanced degree and 2+ year of professional experience generally desired for Sr. Analyst roles
Some applied experience with statistical analyses, forecasting, predictive and prescriptive modeling techniques whether that is through internships, full-time work experience or even personal projects
Experience with a range of data science techniques to extract, transform, harmonize and prepare large-scale data sets for modeling
Expertise writing customized code in common data science languages such as R, Python, or other
Experience with visual storytelling. Knowledge of common visualization platforms (we generally use Tableau or Power BI) is a bonus but not required
Operations or industry exposure is not necessary but an ability to quickly move up the learning curve will be key

Development of new models, as well as ongoing maintenance of existing models, is labor-intensive, and
requires extensive coordination between Engineering, Science. You will be part of the team who is responsible to design and implement a platform that abstracts the lowest level of that ecosystem in a dynamic and generic manner so that Science (and potentially others) can publish and execute models in
the production environment without/minimal the need for direct involvement of Engineering. Ultimately the platform should help accelerate the development of Agronomic Intelligence in Climate.

We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

About Us VIDEO

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

564,Data Scientist,$68K-$123K (Glassdoor est.),"Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact, 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

As our first Data Scientist, you will own our entire data pipeline, from instrumentation and extraction to analytical presentations to the executive team. Building Internet infrastructure is expensive and our business model relies on leveraging data to find as many efficiencies as possible. To that end, you’ll work with Product to find creative ways to reduce hardware costs, with Growth to squeeze every last conversion out of our onboarding funnel, with Engineering to discern network-wide ramifications of minute changes to router kernel parameters, with Coverage to sketch out the best buildings to target when we launch new markets, and with Operations to identify process breaks before they show up in our top-level metrics.

The ideal candidate is passionate about democratizing our data and eager to wear many hats -- one day might entail installing Tableau and coaching stakeholders on best practices with the new BI tool, while another might involve changing our backend to emit that one metric that’s going to drastically simplify the analysis you’re trying to run. Our entire stack runs on GCP, with BigQuery as our data warehouse and all of our backend written in golang on Google’s Appengine -- bonus points if you come in with experience in those technologies, but we’d also be thrilled to invest in a great candidate that hasn’t worked with those exact products.
What you do
Build and maintain dashboards for core operational metrics (e.g. network reliability, growth funnel)
Own the methodologies behind how we measure ourselves and create new metrics as the business evolves
Clean and organize our data warehouse, manage scheduled aggregations, and expose rich views of data to stakeholders
Run your own investigations into our trickiest problems, finding approachable ways to present and visualize your findings to the rest of the company
Implement simple changes to our codebase when necessary -- you don’t let yourself get blocked on engineering
Chart out Common’s data roadmap, striking the right balance between quick-and-dirty analysis vs. building out robust, scalable data flows.
Requirements
BS with 5+ years of professional experience in a Data Scientist or Data Analyst role
Solid programming skills in at least one language in addition to excellent SQL skills
Experience working with and manipulating large, complex datasets.
Experience solving non-routine analysis problems, choosing the appropriate analytical methods and carrying the entire analysis from initial data gathering and requirements specification to final reporting and stakeholder presentation
Experience building, managing and organizing ETLs and data pipelinesExperience working with stakeholders to produce golden data datasets and clear views of common data needs
Excited to work in a startup environment on a small team; creative, resourceful, comfortable in a fast-moving environment. Excited to take on a wide range of responsibilities and cover many different roles loosely aligned around Data.
Demonstrated leadership and self-direction with a willingness to both teach others and learn new techniques.

568,Machine Learning Engineer,$68K-$123K (Glassdoor est.),"Role Description
Triplebyte screens and evaluates thousands of engineers per month to find the best candidates for our partner companies. Human decision making doesn't work at our scale; our marketplace is powered by automated assessment and decision making. Triplebyte has three cornerstone ML products: our quiz, our interview, and our matchmaking. As a machine learning engineer, you'll be responsible for the end-to-end process of designing and running experiments to serving production models at scale. Some of our pipelines use off the shelf components, but we're also implementing custom models and techniques from the latest research papers. We're also building forecasting tools for internal teams to measure and predict outcomes. This is an ideal role for an engineer or data scientist who wants the scope and responsibility to own features/products from the inception and research phase through to measuring real-world results.
Fields your work will touch on
Psychometrics
Recommender systems
Time series analysis
Survival analysis
Bayesian inference
Probabilistic programming
Requirements
Robust exploratory/experimental skills. We have a novel dataset of candidate profiles and interview outcomes from our candidate screening process and our hiring marketplace. You'll be responsible for designing and evaluating experiments to predict downstream outcomes.
Ability to implement models from research. Some of our best improvements in both speed and predictiveness has come from doing literature surveys and implementing novel techniques from research papers.
Engineering skills. This is a hybrid research/engineering role. You'll be responsible for productionizing your pipelines/models and integrating against our back-end services.
About Triplebyte
Triplebyte is a hiring marketplace used by companies like Apple, Dropbox, Stripe, and Instacart to hire the best technical talent. We are on a mission to build a meritocratic hiring process, and we do all our evaluation background blind. Our ultimate goal is to collect the largest dataset and use this to build the world's best technical hiring process. No other company has successfully done what we're doing in this field.
We are growing extremely quickly, working on a problem that is fundamental, sitting at the crossroads between the workforce and employers. Ten years from now, it'll look silly to use anything other than Triplebyte for technical hiring.
Company Culture
We have a laid-back, friendly office culture. Over lunch you'll often find us discussing the latest in technology, books, and pop culture, and then maybe getting in a quick game of chess or babyfoot (foosball).
Since we're an early-stage company, we move fast, and it's important that each member of our team is able to take ownership of projects by defining problems, brainstorming solutions, and running experiments.",3.2,"Triplebyte

We are looking for an individual to drive,build and deliver The Agronomic Intelligence Platform which can be leveraged by various data science and engineering organizations through Climate’s Digital Farming Platform (DFP).
You will be responsible for Design and implement highly scalable data-intensive processing systems, highly scalable microservice-based services that can be put to use by various teams within the Climate organization, as well as by partners through Climate’s Digital Farming Platform. . As an Agronomic Intelligence Platform Engineer you will be responsible for designing and implementing APIS, SDKs and services.
What You Will Do
As Climate matures as a data company there is a need to author, create and manipulate models with varying inputs, performance SLA’s and workflows.Generally the model development life cycle starts with
discovery after a few iterations of the internal logic developed independently by Science. Once the model matures enough or ready to be put to test against large volumes of data, then re-implemented by Engineering to conform to the requirements and restrictions of production processes and infrastructure.
Development of new models, as well as ongoing maintenance of existing models, is labor-intensive, and
requires extensive coordination between Engineering, Science. You will be part of the team who is responsible to design and implement a platform that abstracts the lowest level of that ecosystem in a dynamic and generic manner so that Science (and potentially others) can publish and execute models in
the production environment without/minimal the need for direct involvement of Engineering. Ultimately the platform should help accelerate the development of Agronomic Intelligence in Climate.

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.

Essential Functions

The College of Business Administration at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO), an AACSB accredited institution, is located in the heart of Omaha, Nebraska, a metropolitan area with an MSA population of approximately 942,198. Omaha is home to ten Fortune 1000 firms and has a strong business environment. UNO offers about 200 programs of study to approximately 15,575 students. Despite its size, small classes are the norm. Additional information about UNO can be found at https://www.unomaha.edu.

The Department of Economics at the University of Nebraska at Omaha invites applications for an instructor in the area of business analytics and data science. While this is an instructor position, salary will be commensurate with the skills necessary for this highly technical teaching position.
The College of Business Administration (CBA) offers several high-demand data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels with concentrations in Econometrics and Data Analytics as well as Business Analytics. This position will play a key role in growing and expanding the program through teaching and curriculum development activities. We recommend the candidate familiarize themselves with the following program pages:

https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-business-administration/mba/program/data-analytics.php
https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-business-administration/economics/undergraduate-program/business-analytics.php

A top candidate is expected to be a teaching specialist with a strong passion for teaching Business/Data Analytics courses. The successful candidate will likely teach courses such as master’s level econometrics, advanced econometric classes with some machine learning content, business reporting classes (e.g. Power BI, Tableau, Google Data Studio), SQL and database/data storage class, quantitative/statistics courses, and, when the need arises, large principles-level classes. Given the nature of these courses, a deep understanding of data storage and programming techniques is highly valued. However, the Department of Economics prefers a candidate who is a passionate instructor with fluency in some of the listed skills (and interest in future mastery of the listed languages and software) over a candidate who has mastered all of the languages and software but is less enthusiastic about providing excellent instruction at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

UNO is strongly integrated with local employers, forming partnerships with local organizations to enhance the students’ learning experience is expected. In particular, we expect that some classes taught by the instructor will be integrated with partners in the Department of Homeland Security as part of a grant recently awarded to our college through the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center of Excellence (NCITE). Other local partnerships (as well as other innovative teaching techniques) are encouraged, and UNO strives to “grow with and within our thriving community.”

CBA’s Department of Economics has a strong culture of teaching. The department houses the UNO Center for Economic Education, the production office of the Journal of Economics Teaching, and multiple faculty members who research education or learning. Additionally, the successful candidate will join an existing team of data scientists with a strong commitment to teaching quality and student success. The successful candidate should want to join this community of teachers and be equally committed to student success.

To apply, go to https://unomaha.peopleadmin.com/. Cover letters, curriculum vitae or resume, and evidence of teaching effectiveness (e.g., teaching innovations designed by the applicant, involvement in programs related to instructional excellence), and a statement of teaching philosophy addressing the candidate’s ability to foster an inclusive learning environment for a community of diverse learners. Letters of reference will be requested from finalists for the position at a later date.

Review of applications will begin October 1, 2020. The position is open until filled but only applications received by October 1, 2020 can be assured full consideration. We will continue to accept applications until the position is filled. An ideal candidate would be available to begin work in January, 2021, but could be delayed to August, 2021 if needed. For general employment information, go to https://www.unomaha.edu/humanresources/.

The university and department have a strong commitment to achieving diversity among faculty and staff. The University of Nebraska does not discriminate based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, marital status, and/or political affiliation in its programs, activities, or employment.
